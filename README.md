# **MULTI-LABEL ABNORMALITY CLASSIFICATION FROM 12-LEAD ECG USING A 2D RESIDUAL U-NET**   
   
This is an official repo of the paper "**MULTI-LABEL ABNORMALITY CLASSIFICATION FROM 12-LEAD ECG USING A 2D RESIDUAL U-NET**," which is accepted to ICASSP 2024.   

**Abstract**ï¼šThis paper proposes a two-dimensional (2D) deep neural network (DNN) model for the electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality classification, which effectively utilizes the inter and intra-lead information comprised in the 12-lead ECG.
The proposed model is designed using a stack of residual U-shaped (ResU) blocks so that it can effectively capture ECG features in a multiscale.
The 2D features extracted by the ResU block are down-mixed to 1D features using a lead combiner block designed to merge features of the lead domain into both the time and channel domain.
Through experiments, we confirm that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in various metrics.
